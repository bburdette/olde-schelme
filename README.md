# olde-schelme
A minimal scheme-eque language written in Elm.  This is an old version of schelme, thats a good bit simpler, but lacks incremental execution.  Just keeping it here for reference, dev is focused on the new one now.  If you were concerned about executing schelme code quickly, this would probably be better than the incremental one.
