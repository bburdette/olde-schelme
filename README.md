# schelme
A minimal scheme-eque language written in Elm.  

At this point, VERY minimal.  Hopefully will be useful for scripting in games, that kind of thing.  

Try it out [here](https://bburdette.github.io/schelmeex1.html).

And there's also a fancy [robot battle demo](https://bburdette.github.io/schelmebots1.html)!

No language reference yet, but there's some default demo code if you add a bot.
